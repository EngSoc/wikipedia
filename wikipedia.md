The '''University of Waterloo Engineering Society''', also known as the '''Waterloo Engineering Society''', '''Engineering Society''', or '''EngSoc''', is a non-profit organization which represents the undergraduate Engineering student population at the [[University of Waterloo]]. Built on legacy and tradition, it continues to unify the students in the [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Engineering|Faculty of Engineering]] and provide resources for its members to develop and succeed as undergraduate students and beyond. <ref name="student-life">{{cite web|title=Student Life|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/future-undergraduate-students/student-life|department=Engineering|publisher=University of Waterloo|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref> As well as providing student representation for Engineering students academically, socially, and professionally at a Faculty and University level, it is also a member of the provincial [http://www.essoc.ca/ Engineering Students' Societies' Council of Ontario (ESSCO)] and the national [[Canadian Federation of Engineering Students|Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES)]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=Member Schools|url=https://www.essco.ca/members|publisher=Engineering Students' Societies' Council of Ontario|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=Members|url=https://cfes.ca/members/|publisher=Canadian Federation of Engineering Students|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>

==About==
The Engineering Society is the official representative for [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] [[Engineering education|Engineering students]] at the University of Waterloo. It voices the student opinion to numerous committees, councils and governing bodies throughout the entire university such as the Faculty of Engineering, University Administration, Co-operative and Experiential Education, as well as to the Engineering Societies of other universities and external organizations. The Executive of the Engineering Society work to ensure that all members are given the opportunity to voice their opinion on any subject relevant to the students.

The Engineering Society provides many services to students to better their time here at Waterloo. Some of these services include POETS (engineering student lounge), the Coffee and Donut shop (C&D), Novelties (merchandise store), RidgidWare (hardware store), an online exam bank, resume critiques, work report binding, technical workshops, mental health support, and much more.

Each term, the Engineering Society runs many different events for students that are organized by student directors. These events range from ski trips, to hackathons, to theatre productions, to trips to the Toronto Pride Parade, to social gatherings like a semi-formal dance, and more. <ref>{{cite web|title=Student Societies|url=https://wusa.ca/student-bodies/student-societies|publisher=Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref> <ref name="who-are-we">{{cite web|title=Who Are We?|url=https://www.engsoc.uwaterloo.ca/about-us/who-are-we/|publisher=University of Waterloo Engineering Society|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>

===A-Soc and B-Soc===
As Waterloo Engineering students alternate between work terms and school terms every four months, the Engineering Society is run alternately by two teams of students: Society "A" (A-Soc) and Society "B" (B-Soc). Each term the on-stream society switches between the two societies, allowing the maintenance of a consistent set of executive, directors, and members. Depending on how each program's streaming schedule is arranged, a student may switch societies more than once during their time at Waterloo. Whichever society is on-term while a student is in a school term is the society of which they are currently a member. During even numbered years, A-Society is in school during the Winter and Fall terms, and B-Society is in school during the Spring term. During odd numbered years, A-Society is in school during the Spring term, and B-Society is in school during the Winter and Fall terms. <ref name="who-are-we" />

==History==
When the University of Waterloo, then called the Waterloo College Associate Faculties, opened to students in the Spring of 1957, the first class on campus was composed of 74 male engineering students. <ref>{{cite web|title=Our History|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/about/our-history|department=Engineering|publisher=University of Waterloo|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref> <ref name="timelines">{{cite web|title=Timelines|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/about/our-history/timelines|department=Engineering|publisher=University of Waterloo|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref> With a new co-operative education system and modified school year (at the time 4 terms of three months each), the University began to grow, and soon after, in 1958, the inaugural engineering classes formed the first formal student organization on campus, the Engineering Council.

Before the University of Waterloo began making headlines for its academic prowess, the engineering students made national headlines in 1958 with a prank they pulled on the [[Waterloo, Ontario|City of Waterloo]] by painting "BEER" on a city water tower. It was this student spirit and unity that would give the Engineering Council the ability to grow, and to continue the tradition of faculty pride. <ref>{{cite web|last=Martha|first=Lauzon|title=The Great Water Tower Caper|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/library/special-collections-archives/blog/post/great-water-tower-caper|department=Special Collections & Archives|publisher=University of Waterloo|date=8 February 2016|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|last=Bow|first=Patricia|title=The Great Water Tower Caper|url=https://bulletin.uwaterloo.ca/1999/sep/02th.html|department=Daily Bulletin|publisher=University of Waterloo|date=2 September 1999|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref> <ref name="timelines"/>

As time progressed, the Engineering Council became the Engineering Society, and in 1971 a withdrawal from the [[Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association|Federation of Students]] occurred and a Constitution was drafted and approved, creating the Engineering Society known today. <ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=Engineers demonstrate strong federation desire|url=http://archive.uwimprint.ca/archives/1970-71_v11/1970-71_v11,n48_Chevron.pdf|work=The Chevron|location=University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada|date=19 March 1971|volume=11|issue=48|page=3|access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref> While Waterloo grew out of the muddy farm fields into an international academic powerhouse, the Engineering Society grew out of the original engineering huts of the late 50's into the largest, most active student society on campus and one of the most active in all of Canada. <ref name="student-life"/> <ref name="who-are-we" />

===The Crest===
The Engineering Society crest was designed in 1968 by Veikko Kuronen as an entry to a logo design contest. It has maintained its original form over the years, with symbols representing each of the six disciplines that existed at Waterloo at the time: the partial gear represents Mechanical Engineering, the lightning bolt represents Electrical Engineering, the test tube represents Chemical Engineering, the transit represents Civil Engineering, the grey background represents Geological Engineering, and Systems Design is represented as the unifying circle which ties them all together. <ref>{{cite news|last=Meyer|first=Paul|title=A History of the Crest|url=https://pdfslide.net/documents/iron-warrior-volume-8-issue-10.html|work=Iron Warrior|location=University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada|date=13 November 1987|volume=8|issue=10|page=8|access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|last=Meyer|first=Paul|title=A History of the Crest|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/181611400/The-Iron-Warrior-Volume-10-Issue-3|work=The Iron Warrior|location=University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada|date=28 February 1997|volume=10|issue=3|page=20|access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref> Every discipline that has been introduced since then also has representation within the original crest design. <ref name="traditions">{{cite web|title=Traditions|url=https://www.engsoc.uwaterloo.ca/about-us/traditions/|publisher=University of Waterloo Engineering Society|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>

==Executive==
Executive are student-elected positions voted on by all on-term Engineering undergraduate students. There are two sets of Executive for Society "A" and Society "B", and an Executive serves for 16 consecutive months. Executive hire commissioners to assist them with the day-to-day operations of the Engineering Society, as well as exploring the growth of certain portfolios. Both Executive and Commissioners can hire directors, who they will work with to ensure that all the Engineering Society services and events run successfully. Commissionerships and directorships are held for 8 months and 4 months respectively. <ref name="who-are-we" />

===The President===
The President is the face and voice of the Engineering Society, and it is ultimately their responsibility to ensure that the whole organization is properly represented and all operations are running smoothly. They represent engineering student interests at all times, including at various faculty and university meetings, where they do their best to ensure that actions taken by these groups serve their constituency. They are the official student link to the Dean's Office and regularly meet with the Undergraduate Student Liaison Officer to present feedback on current issues affecting students. They also serve as the default student representative on tribunals held by the Faculty Committee for Student Appeals (FCSA). The President accompanies the VP Communications at certain larger conferences including CFES Engineering Leadership Conference (CELC), ESSCO Presidents' Meeting (ESSCO PM), and ESSCO Annual General Meeting (ESSCO AGM). The on-term President serves as the spokesperson for the Tool, and is the sole person responsible for its wellbeing. They are also responsible for ensuring the Engineering Society's documentation is up to date (Bylaws, Policy Manual, internal documents, and records). The president welcomes students to meet with them to discuss any concerns or suggestions they may have about the Engineering Society, and makes a strong effort to get to know their membership. <ref name="who-are-we" />

===The Vice President, Academic===
The VP Academic is responsible for representing student interests in all matters that are academic in nature. This includes curriculum, academic policies, cooperative education, and professional development. They attend meetings on various committees and are also responsible for managing the Engineering Society's academic services and directorships, which include the Exam Bank, Resume Critiques and Interview Skills Workshops, Course Critiques, and the Career Fair. They also act as a liaison between Academic Reps and the Engineering Society, and may choose to offer resources to Academic Reps, which frequently include workshops. Another responsibility of the VP Academic is to actively pursue resolutions to any general academic concerns that students have. <ref name="who-are-we" />

===The Vice President, Communications===
The VP Communications serves as a representative of the Engineering Society to external organizations and to the community. They work with professional organizations such as Professional Engineers Ontario (PEO) and the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (OSPE) to promote student involvement in the engineering profession. In addition, the VP Communications frequently sits on student councils at a provincial and federal level, which allows them to liaise with representatives from other schools and share best practices for the benefit of the Waterloo Engineering Society. They also co-ordinate delegate participation in the Ontario Engineering Competition (OEC) and Canadian Engineering Competition (CEC) as necessary. Another primary component of the VP Communications' portfolio is to coordinate all of the advertising methods for the Engineering Society members through mailing lists and other social media platforms. <ref name="who-are-we" />

===The Vice President, Finance===
The VP Finance is responsible for the fiscal affairs of the Engineering Society, which includes the dispersal of funds, and the creation and management of the termly budget. Directors use the VP Finance as a resource in planning the financial aspects of their events and services, and will submit their expense claims to the VP Finance for reimbursement. The VP Finance has signing authority of the Engineering Society Accounts, is responsible for managing the Novelties Store, RidgidWare, and POETS. The VP Finance typically also manages capital expenditures, and brainstorms ways to disperse funds in ways that most benefit students. <ref name="who-are-we" />

===The Vice President, Student Life===
The VP Student Life oversees all of the Engineering Society's social events, and ensures all of the responsibilities of those directorships are fulfilled. The VP Student Life is prepared to provide any support required by such directors, which includes representing directorship concerns at executive meetings, answering resource and logistics questions, and resolving conflicts.The VP Student Life is responsible for creating the termly calendar of events and services. Another primary component of the VP Student Life portfolio is to promote Waterloo Engineering to the community at large through outreach and charity initiatives. The VP Student Life also manages and facilitates the Waterloo Engineering Competition (WEC) with the help of a commissioner and team of directors. <ref name="who-are-we" />

==Council==
The Waterloo Engineering Society Council exists to co-ordinate the official business, approve the allocation of funds, and exercise control over the actions of the on-term Society.

Council seats consist of the on-term executive officers, the off-term president, and up to two representatives from each on-term class. The Speaker, chosen termly by the on-term President, acts as Council chair in accordance with Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised. Council meetings are public and anyone may attend; however, speaking privileges are reserved for members of the Engineering Society or those who are recognized by a member. The rights to move motions, second motions, and vote are reserved for those who hold an official seat. Class representatives may proxy their rights to any on-term member by giving at least 24 hours' notice to the Speaker.

Class reps are elected by majority vote in a self-regulated in-class election each academic term. If no official election takes place, the previous term's class reps maintain their council seat. First year class representative elections are facilitated by the current Society executives in advance of the first Council meeting of the term. Class reps are responsible for attending all meetings and voting on behalf of their class, collecting feedback from their class prior to meetings, and updating their class with recent news and upcoming events after meetings. Class reps also encourage and facilitate class participation in Engineering Society events.

Classes also elect Academic Class Representatives who act as liaisons to professors, TAs, and the department. Each class will also have a Waterloo Engineering Endowment Fund (WEEF) Representative to sit on the WEEF Funding Council. Class reps for Engineering Society Council are a separate position but can be held by the same person. <ref>{{cite web|title=Council|url=https://www.engsoc.uwaterloo.ca/get-involved/council/|publisher=University of Waterloo Engineering Society|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>

===Joint Annual General Meeting===
A General Meeting follows a similar procedure to Council, following Robert's Rules of Order and allowing people to submit motions. However, one notable difference is that, instead of representing their class, any Engineering Society member attending represents themselves and gets one vote. This meeting occurs every year in either February or March, and represents both Societies. As such, quorum required is at least 50 A-Society and 50 B-Society votes, and each motion must past two separate votes, one by each Society, in order to pass. This meeting ratifies every motion passed in council and can also pass motions affecting the Governing Documents without further steps required. It also elects the Board of Directors for the upcoming term. <ref>{{cite report|chapter-format=PDF|title=Bylaw 1: Constitution|chapter=III|pages=B,C,F|chapter-url=https://engsoc.app.box.com/s/jot77xirunizoaf1zj1hcskbxbaorizb|publisher=University of Waterloo Engineering Society|date=7 March 1992|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>

==Traditions==

===The Tool===
The Tool is a sixty-inch triple chrome-plated adjustable pipe wrench, forged by the [[Ridgid|Ridge Tool Company of Elyria, OH, USA]]. It is the only known fully chromed pipe wrench of its type in the world. This is the mascot of the University of Waterloo Engineering Society and was chosen as part of a public vote on both societies in the late 1960s. Jim Pike, A-Society President at the time, wrote to the Ridge Tool Company and was able to get this mascot donated to the Engineering Society. This was on the condition that it would be known as "The Ridgid Tool", and that it would retain its original orange colours out of respect for the Ridge Tool Company. Once The Tool was received in the summer of 1968, it was almost immediately chromed which unintentionally made it lose its orange colouring. Later on, it was officially renamed from "The Ridgid Tool" to "The Tool". On October 5, 1968, the Tool made its first official public appearance, at an Engineering Semi-Formal dance. From that point forward, it has been at every major event of the Engineering Society. <ref>{{cite news|last=Pike|first=Jim|title=Origins of TOOL|url=http://iwarrior.uwaterloo.ca/pdf/w00i2.pdf|work=The Iron Warrior|location=University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada|date=28 January 2000|volume=24|issue=2|page=4|access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref>

The Tool is guarded by a group known as Tool Bearers. They are cloaked in a black and gold uniform to not reveal their identity, and are the official guardians of the Tool in public and in private. They are responsible for showing and protecting it at major events along with the on-stream Engineering Society president. The Tool may only be touched by those who wear an Iron Ring, and is meant to act as a unifying symbol of pride for Waterloo Engineers.

In the early days of the Tool, there have been few instances where it has been stolen by another school. The most notable of these pranks happened in January 1982, when it was stolen while being transported back to Waterloo by University of Toronto students and withheld for two months.<ref>{{cite news|last=McBride|first=Cathy|title=Tool missing - cops on case|url=http://archive.uwimprint.ca/archives/1981-82_v04/1981-82_v04,n27_Imprint.pdf|work=Imprint|location=University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada|date=12 February 1982|volume=4|issue=26|page=3|access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref> Due to the size of The Tool, a mini-Tool named "Junior" was created for the purpose of transportation to conferences and for some habitual activities like Engineering Society Council. The Tool rarely makes an appearance outside of the University as a result, most notably during the Toronto Pride Parade. <ref name="traditions" />

===The Iron Ring===
The [[Iron Ring]] is both a symbol of pride in the engineering profession and a reminder of the engineer's obligation to live by a high standard of professional conduct. The legend of the Iron Ring is that it is forged from a steel beam of the ill-fated Quebec bridge, which collapsed in 1907 due to poor engineering and planning, killing 75 construction workers. Worn on the pinky finger of one's working hand, the Iron Ring is given to 4th year students at a voluntary ceremony known as the "[[Ritual of the Calling of the Engineer]]".

The Ritual of the Calling of the Engineer has a history dating back to 1922, when seven former presidents of the Engineering Institute of Canada attended a meeting in Montréal with other engineers. One of the speakers was civil engineer Professor Haultain, of the University of Toronto. He felt that an organization was needed to bind all members of the engineering profession in Canada more closely. He also felt that an obligation or statement of ethics to which a young graduate in engineering could subscribe should be developed. The seven past-presidents of the Engineering Institute of Canada were very receptive to this idea. Haultain wrote to Rudyard Kipling, who had made reference to the work of engineers in some of his poems and writings. He asked Kipling for his assistance in developing a suitably dignified obligation and ceremony for its undertaking. Kipling was very enthusiastic in his response and shortly produced both an obligation and a ceremony formally entitled "The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer". <ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Ritual|url=https://www.ironringcamp15.com/historyofritual|publisher=Camp 15 Waterloo|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref> This ritual is colloqually called the Iron Ring Ceremony (IRC). <ref>{{cite web|title=Iron ring|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/current-undergraduate-students/iron-ring|department=Engineering|publisher=University of Waterloo|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>

The objective of The Ritual can be stated as follows: The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer has been instituted with the simple end of directing the newly qualified engineer toward a consciousness of the profession and its social significance and indicating to the more experienced engineer their responsibilities in welcoming and supporting the newer engineers when they are ready to enter the profession. <ref>{{cite web|title=Background|url=https://www.ironring.ca/background-en/|publisher=Corporation of the Seven Wardens|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>

This Iron Ring Ceremony is directly followed up by the Iron Ring Stag (IRS), a celebration that occurs for the graduating class every year in the following evening. It is the first opportunity for the newly-ringed students to touch The Tool. <ref name="traditions" />

===Purpling===
[[Engineering_traditions_in_Canada#Purple|Purpling]] is the act of dying your skin purple out of respect for the engineering profession and dedication to your school. The legend is that the engineers aboard the Titanic wore purple coveralls, and as the ship sank, they remained in the engine rooms to keep the furnaces going so that the smoke would act as a signal to other ships. They sacrificed their lives to attempt to save others. In addition, it is said that the Royal Engineers of the British Army wore a purple armband. Much like the Iron Ring, purpling is done out of respect for those that gave their lives for and because of our profession and as a reminder of the responsibility all engineers share. Over the years purpling has evolved to be a way for engineering students to show their sense of pride and cultivate engineering spirit. <ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Bill|title=Why Engineering is Purple|url=https://profbillanderson.com/2019/04/16/why-engineering-is-purple/|date=16 April 2019|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>

Purpling at Waterloo only occurs during special event and traditions. The most common time to see purple engineers is during Orientation week when many leaders and first years dye themselves. During Summer or Fall terms there may be charity purpling events where students collect pledges to die themselves purple to raise money for charity. Additionally, once an Engineering Society president is elected, they must remained chained to a couch in CPH Foyer dyed purple from head to toe for the entire day of their initiation until the Council Meeting that evening where they are officially sworn into office. <ref name="traditions" />

===Godiva's Hymn===
The [[Godiva's Hymn|Engineering Hymn]] is sung across Canada by engineers with many different versus and variations. Inspired by [[Lady Godiva]] and her sadness at the plight of the poor in 11th century England the hymn recounts the tale of Godiva's husband, Leofric, who was a man of power and could have alleviated the suffering inflicted on the destitute, had he wanted to do so. He agreed to lower taxes at the request of his lovely wife, but only if she would ride a horse completely naked through the streets of Coventry, thinking that she would not go through with it. She did, but before her ride, she told the villagers of her plan and asked that they not watch her. Since then, Godiva's legendary courage has been the source of many works of art, including the Engineering Hymn. <ref>{{cite web|last=Grout|first=James|title=Lady Godiva (Godgifu)|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/britannia/anglo-saxon/flowers/godiva.html|publisher=Encyclopaedia Romana|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ben|title=Lady Godiva|url=https://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Lady-Godiva/|publisher=Historic UK|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>

The Hymn is sung at many engineering celebrations and has been updated over the years to in an attempt to keep up with the changing culture while still maintaining the spirit that brings Canadian Engineering students together. <ref name="traditions" />

===Clothing===
The University of Waterloo jackets have been around since the early 1960s. The jacket started as a symbol worn to show drivers that they could trust Waterloo Engineering students who were looking to hitchhike a ride to campus. The original jackets were only available to the Engineers, and were made of purple corduroy with gold lettering. Over the years this has evolved into the black leather jackets that are available to all faculties. The jackets are custom fitted, embroidered with a student's graduation year on the right sleeve, their  department on the left sleeve, the Waterloo crest on the front, and "WATERLOO ENGINEERING" on the back. <ref>{{cite news|last=Seliske|first=Mike|title=Should you purchase an Engineering Leather Jacket?|url=http://iwarrior.uwaterloo.ca/pdf/w11i1.pdf|work=The Iron Warrior|location=University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada|date=19 January 2011|volume=32|issue=1|page=13|access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref>

Coveralls are worn as a representation of the Engineering spirit at the University of Waterloo. Starting off as swag that the Executive of the Engineering Society exclusively owned, they have expanded drastically as students craved the idea of showing off their pride of being in Engineering. Engineering Society coveralls have the Engineering Society logo on the back and "Engineering" written all the way down the left leg. On the right arm, there are two lines of embroidery, usually indicating the person's name, their program and their year of graduation. Patches are one of the main ways of decorating coveralls. They are used as a form of expressing unity, as well as personality due to the endless ways people design and decorate their coveralls. Patch trading is encouraged at a provincial and national scale, and on occasion the body parts of a coverall are traded. <ref name="traditions" />

==Events and Services==

The events that the Engineering Society offers change each term, as new students bring new ideas and some old ideas don't persist. However, the following are some of the long-standing major events the Engineering Society offers: <ref>{{cite web|title=Events|url=https://www.engsoc.uwaterloo.ca/events/|publisher=University of Waterloo Engineering Society|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=Outreach Opportunities|url=https://www.engsoc.uwaterloo.ca/get-involved/outreach-opportunities/|publisher=University of Waterloo Engineering Society|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>
